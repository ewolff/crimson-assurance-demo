# Docker Container for Crimson Insurance Demo

[Deutsche Anleitung zum Starten des Beispiels](WIE-LAUFEN.md)

This project provides Docker containers for the Crimson demo, see
https://github.com/crimson-assurance . This project uses a fork of the
original code

It consists of four services: portal, letter, notify claims and
postbox.

To start run `docker-compose up -d`. This will also build
the Docker images. For a detailed guide see
[How to run](HOW-TO-RUN.md).

The Docker containers should run on `localhost`. Otherwise set the
environment variable `CRIMSON_SERVER` to the host the containers run on.

Points to note:

* There are some customers - try Mei or MÃ¼l etc
* The postbox is transcluded from the server running on port 3001
* The link to write a letter or notify a claim will go to different
  applications (on port 3002 and 3003)
* Behind the scenes a project with the shared assets ensure common UI
elements.
* The Postbox is written in Java / Spring Boot, the other projects in NodeJS.

This project is based on a very similar project by @mjansing and
@moonglum .
